Great! 🚀 You’ve built a **Face Recognition Attendance System** project in Python using **OpenCV + face\_recognition + Pandas**.
Here’s a **README.md** you can directly put on GitHub to explain your project:

# 🎓 Face Recognition Attendance System

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Face Recognition-based Attendance System** built using **Python, OpenCV, and the face\_recognition library**.
It detects and recognizes faces from a live webcam feed, then automatically records the student’s attendance in a **CSV file** with a timestamp.

---

## ⚡ Features

✅ Real-time **face detection & recognition** using webcam
✅ Maintains **attendance logs in CSV** format (with name & time)
✅ Supports multiple known faces (students dataset)
✅ Displays recognition results on the screen with “Present” status
✅ Easy to extend by adding more student images

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x**
* **OpenCV** – for image/video processing
* **face\_recognition** – for face encoding & comparison
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Pandas & CSV** – for handling attendance data
* **DateTime** – timestamping attendance records

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-attendance.git
cd face-recognition-attendance
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or manually install:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas face-recognition
```

3. Add student images

* Place images of students inside the `students/` folder.
* Update the script with their names & image paths.

4. Run the program

```bash
python attendance.py
```

5. Quit the program

* Press `q` in the camera window to exit.
* Attendance will be saved in a **CSV file named with the current date** (e.g., `2025-08-17.csv`).

## 📊 Output Example (CSV)

```
Name, Time
Alakh, 10:32:15
Sunny Deol, 10:33:05
Akarsh, 10:34:40
```

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add database integration (MySQL / SQLite) for attendance storage.
* Build a web dashboard for analytics & visualization.
* Send email/SMS notification for absentees.
* Improve recognition accuracy using deep learning models.
